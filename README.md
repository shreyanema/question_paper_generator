# question_paper_generator

This is a project to generate question papers randomly as per examination pattern.
Question papers can be generated randomly without any hassle.
This Project helps to avoid paperleak in an institute.
I have used PHP, MySQL, Javascript, Ajax, JQuery, Bootstrap, CSS, and SemanticUi.
